# Overview

This Data Analysis project to have experience collecting data from kaggle.com and using pandas to read the data in python and be able to analyze it.  I hope to further my software development skills to understand this area of computer science.

The data I am analyzing is from kaggle.com.  The data is called, Linkedin Jobs and Skills.  It will show what kinds of jobs are offered and if one department or another has a higher number of job offereings.  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024/code

The purpose for writing this software to analyze the data is to get a clearer picture of how many computer science jobs there are.  I am nearing the end of my education and am excited to see what kinds of jobs are available.
